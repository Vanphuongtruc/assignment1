                <P>
                    I want to make a cooking app where user input ingredients they have at their
                    place and this app will give user a list of recipes and suggestions for dishes using
                    available ingredients source. This app can also help you track expiry of food in your fridge.
                    The reason why I came up with this idea is because of a friend of mine. She came from a rich
                    family and has everything done for her when needed but then she moved to Australia 4 months ago and cooking
                    was a terrible struggle when she has to do everything by herself. She doesn’t have enough time learning how
                    to cook properly and sometimes she used expired things in the fridge as she was too busy. Apparently,
                    this app haven’t got a proper name yet.
                </P>

                <P>
                    This app isn’t going to be something very big or serious, the main goal of making it is just to help your daily
                    life easier and more convenient. People are getting so busy these day that we don’t have time to prepare and
                    eat proper meal because we are lazy at cooking, the main reason for laziness is that we are lazy to think of
                    what to cook, lazy to drive to the supermarket to find a place to park and to stand in a long line waiting
                    until our turn to pay, been through all that really destroy our mood for cooking. According the internet,
                    about 36.6% population of the US consume fastfood everyday and that is not very healthy, some people don’t have
                    time so they order fast food, but the other are just lazy and the reason is mentioned above. This is why the creation
                    of this app can be very helpful to many people.
                </P>
                <p><span style="color:cadetblue; font-weight: bolder">DESCRIPTION</span></p>
                <p>
                    This app is going to be quite simple and it can only work online. When register, user will be asked for interest in food for later recommendations. It is also very easy to use this app, first of all user will need to input available ingredients and then this app will show a list of suggestions for dishes along with information such as detailed instruction, cooking time, complexity, calories (so there is no need to worry about your diet) e.t.c There will be a comment section for user to comment and rate the dish suggested so that other user can make decision more easily base on those comments. It will allow user to have a to-cook-dish list for later meals, furthermore user can add notes to the available recipe, by this way user will be able experiment and make a dish that suit more to their appetite. About the expiry tracking feature, user will need to input the name of the product, the day user buy that product and where it will be put (in the fridge or outside), after that this app will link to calendar and make a reminder on which day that product will expired.
This app is quite simple, It just needs to collect data and recipes from the internet, analyze and sort them into groups (dessert, appetizer, vegan,…) so that giving suggestion will be clearer to the user. So the first technology I think of for this app is IoT.
However, this app may have some problems as it gets data from the internet so it cannot know the result whether the dish is good or bad and this may dissatisfied  users.

                <p>
                    In order to make this app, I need some basic skills such as:</p>
            <p>-	Coding skill</p>
            <p>-	Platform app development.</p>
            <p>-	Security.</p>
            <p>-	Internet of things.</p>
            <p>-	Quality user interface design.</p>

                </p>
                <p><span style="color:cadetblue; font-weight: bolder">OUTCOME</span></p>
                <p>
                    This app will help user to have a better cooking habits, will save your precious time spent on the whole process metioned above  and will make the best use of your available ingredients. Afterall, the main purpose of this is nothing so serious, it is just for the sake of convenience.
Hope that I can help many people on this problem and have positive impacts on those using my app, even little will be good, too.
