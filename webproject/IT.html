                <h1>MY INTEREST IN IT</h1>
                <p><span style="color: olivedrab; font-weight: bolder; font-size: 1.4em">What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?
                    Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any)?</span></p>
                <p>
                    - Up until now, I haven’t found out what is my particular interest in IT yet, I just feel like it and I am really into IT.
                    Maybe I will figure it out while studying, soon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    - I am not sure when did it start, but since I was in middle school, I have always been into Technology but I didn’t realize,
                    I thought it was just one off my favorite topics read about. I’ve been exposed to technology since I was small and I was amazed with
                    what technology could do, for example: “WOW, THE INTERNET IS SO COOOOOL; WOW, SMARTPHONE IS LIKE A MINI COMPUTER, WILL I BE COOLER IF
                    I HAVE A PHONE, e.t.c. Those experience might have started  my love for technology. It was not until the second half of my 12th grade
                    did I realized I have an interest in IT, that was also the moment I decided to study IT.
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Actually, there wasn’t any event or person that sparked my interest. My liking was just there and grew little by little through time.
                    I don’t know why but I feel like I just want to. Technology now has a very important role in our modern daily life, its impact has
                    reached a scale that has never been seen in mankind history. The idea that something I create can have such impact on others life,
                    or the fact that technology can make our future somethings that the old generate could never have dreamt of, is very seducing and
                    charming on its own way, and that is probably what has driven my interest and passion for IT.
                </p>
                <p>
                    - To be honest, I am a total newbie to IT, I have no experience and I know nothing about coding but I can learn, I don’t have skills
                    but I have strong determination!! Creating this website fills me with determination (actually not but I am just trying to be funny…).
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Sorry for the childhood story but I really don’t know how to describe that part properly.
                </p>

                <p><span style="color: olivedrab; font-weight: bolder; font-size: 1.4em">Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</span></p>
                <p>
                    I chose RMIT because this university has very good reputation, has  undeniable world-class teaching quality.
                    At RMIT, I can learn from IT experts  and the programs here are kept up to date with latest trends in the industry.
                    RMIT also have the best facilities with can provides me with the best education. I want to experience the internationa
                    l environment at RMIT as this will help me gain social skills that is needed for my future career. Besides excellent quality,
                    I think RMIT  can also help me develop and complete my character. In general, RMIT has all that I need. One last thing,
                    RMIT students don’t have to study  Marxism-Leninism. My only problem at RMIT is that I haven’t got new friends yet.
                </p>

                <p><span style="color: olivedrab; font-weight: bolder; font-size: 1.4em; margin-top: 150px">What do you expect to learn during your study?</span></p>
                <p>
                     I wish to learn as much as possible because knowledge will never be redundant. Right now, I hope that I can learn
                    all the basics of IT and some skills related to:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1.	Cloud computing
                    2.	Cybersecurity
                    3.	Application development and programming
                    4.	Networking and wireless
                    5.	Analytics and data management e.t.c
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, I expect to develop my soft skills, teamworking skills and a professional working attitude
                    because those skill are essential for my future.
                    At the moment my shyness is preventing me from achieving my goal so I also hope that studying at RMIT
                    can help me improve my confidence.
                </p>
