                <h2>MBTI RESULTS</h2>
                <p><span style="color: blueviolet; font-size: 1.4em; margin-left: 3cm">Meaning</span></p>
                <p>
                   According to the test, I am fiercely independent, I put great importance on personal freedom and self-expression and tend
                    to follow the call of inspiration, in order to be innovative, I need to have freedom otherwise I can quickly lose patience and become
                    dejected. I see life through a prism of emotion, compassion and mysticism. People with this personality usually consider the pursuit
                    of happiness one of their highest priorities in life.
                </p>
                <p>
                     Having this “campaigner” character is like being in a mix, which make me capable of switching from a passionate, driven idealist from
                    the workplace to that imaginative and enthusiastic free spirit. It helps me connect emotionally with other people so that makes it easier
                    for me to cherish people. However, this sometimes may lead to negative results as I may rely too much on my intuition and sometimes can
                    get deeply involve in other’s life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At workplace, Campaigner personality type usually has warmth, creativity and open mindedness, which makes them excellent listeners.
                    I am unlikely to judge anyone, on the contrary, I will discuss and listen to their story enthusiastically. People can count on their
                    campaigner colleague to boost them up. I have a huge circle of friends as I do know many people however, I only have a few trusted friends. When working in a team, teamwork and overall performance are very important to me. I get distracted easily by the environment around me and sometimes by my own imagination, but getting back on track will be my number one priority so it is not much of a problem. Furthermore, stress doesn’t have much impact on me which enable me to work well under pressure. In fact, the ENFP character trait is quite good at coping with stress.
                </p>

                <p><span style="color: blueviolet; font-size: 1.4em; margin-left: 3cm">Influence on my behaviour in a team</span></p>
                <p>
                    I might get into some small arguments with my teammate because of dissent
                    ( which is very timewasting as those arguments will slown down our working pace, but I have changed now because that is unprofessional
                    and nobody likes it, even myself), but eventually, we will always come up with decision that will lead to win-win situations and
                    improve our performance. When my teammates have problems, I’ll always support and cheer them up before finding the solution to their matter.
                    Teamwork usually comes with drama and I am easily affected as I got distracted.
                </p>

                <p><span style="color: blueviolet; font-size: 1.4em; margin-left: 3cm">When forming a team</span></p>
                <p>
                    I prefer working with people I trust so when forming a team, my first priority will be “who is my team member”.
                    Having thorough understanding of each other will make it easier to cooperate so that team performance can be as efficient as possible.
                    However, you cannot choose how to work with, that’s why I am ready to work with anyone, but if I have a chance to choose,
                    I will always go with my first priority.
                </p>

                <h2>CREATIVITY TEST RESULT</h2>
                <p><span style="color: blueviolet; font-size: 1.4em; margin-left: 3cm">Meaning</span></p>
                <p>
                 According to this result, I am quite creative. curiosity and boldness seem to be my 2 strengths that distinguish my creativity point with
                    the typical, they are both significantly higher than the average point( I don’t think I am that brave in real life). Meanwhile,
                    my ability to  always come up with better and stronger idea and ability to deal with large  quantities of information  are just as
                    same as normal standard, which can be my weaknesses in teamworking. My other aspects of creativity such as Perspective and Connection
                    are slightly higher while my Perspective and Paradox and quite better than the norm.
                </p>

                <p><span style="color: blueviolet; font-size: 1.4em; margin-left: 3cm">Influence on my behaviour in a team</span></p>
                <p>
                    In a team, I am not the one who often come up with good idea, however, I can link my teammate’s ideas together and maybe the new
                    combined one can be better than the original. I cannot handle large quantities of information well and it may affect my working pace.
                    As my ability to work with contradicting statements is quite good, I can help my teammate work things out if they have disagreement
                    about each other’s idea. Furthermore, I am not easy to get into a quarrel with other  as I am not stubborn, shifting perspective allows
                    me to understand more about my teammate’s idea so that I could collect the best part of each idea and perfect our final product.
                    Furthermore, we can also avoid unnecessary drama inside the team.
                </p>

                <p><span style="color: blueviolet; font-size: 1.4em; margin-left: 3cm">When forming a team</span></p>
                <p>
                    When forming a team, I need my teammates to be able to come up with good ideas, I also need someone who is good at analyzing data which
                    I am not good at. I am fine with any type of idea as long as we all work our best together as I consider team performance very important

                <p>
                    According to the test result, i can learn through both audiroty and visual. But i thought that my visual was
                    much higher than that.

                    I am not so sure about how my learning style will affect my behaviour in a team, I will figure it out later while working in a group.
